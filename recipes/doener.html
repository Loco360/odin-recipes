    <b>Description:</b> My doner kebab recipe is a close rendition that gives you tantalizing, thinly shaved grilled chicken that you can serve in wraps, platters, or over your favorite salad (I tried it over fattoush recently).
    <br><br>
    Ingredients:
    <ul><li>500g lamb mince</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves - <em>minced or finely grated</em></li>
        <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>sunflower oil - <em>for oiling</em></li>
    </ul> <br>
    <ol><li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with a large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together. You can also just squish everything together in a bowl but this will give you a looser finish. </li>
        <li>Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick sausage, roughly the shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker shape.</li> 
        <li>Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, then unwrap the foil. Place back on the tray and brown under the grill or with a blowtorch.</li>
        <li>lace on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a roasting fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments, including our chilli sauce and garlic yogurt sauce.</li>
